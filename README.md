# KNN Clutering Machine Learning
This is a PYTHON code that uses Machine Learning to perform KNN Clustering.
The data are taken from IBM Developer Skills Network and can be found athttps://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/data/drug200.csv. 
This code use KNN Clustering and loop over K value to find the one that produce best test accuracy. 
The code will generate: 
1) Histogram plot for every feature. 
2) Output file that contains:
   Print Train and Test set dimensions.
   Print Train and test accuracy for every K value (i.e. 1-10).
   Print the best accuracy was with its corresponding K value.
3) Plot Test and Train accuracy vs. K value.
